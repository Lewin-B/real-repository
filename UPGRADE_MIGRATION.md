  "message": "OK. Analyzing the impact of upgrading Next.js from an unknown version to 15.5.4:\n\n**1. package.json:**\n\n*   **Next.js:** Update the `next` dependency to `15.5.4`.\n*   **React and Types:** Review and update `react`, `react-dom`, `@types/react`, and `@types/react-dom`. Ensure that these dependencies are compatible with Next.js 15.5.4 by consulting the official Next.js documentation for compatible version ranges.\n*   **Install:** Run `npm install`. If you run into peer dependency conflicts, use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.\n\n**2. next.config.js:**\n\n*   **Review Configuration:** Carefully examine the contents of `next.config.js` for any deprecated options or breaking changes that were introduced in any of the Next.js versions between the current (unknown) version and 15.5.4. You *must* consult the Next.js documentation for each version. Without the file content, specific recommendations are impossible.\n\n**3. tsconfig.json:**\n\n*   **Target:** Ensure the `compilerOptions.target` is set to `es6` or higher.\n\n**4. Codebase Analysis (app/page.tsx, app/layout.tsx, pages/index.tsx):**\n\n*   **API Usage:** Thoroughly search the application code for usages of the following APIs and verify that they are compatible with Next.js 15.5.4:\n    *   `useFormState`\n    *   `useActionState`\n    *   `NextRequest geo`\n    *   `NextRequest ip`\n    *   `cookies.get`\n    *   `headers.get`\n    *   `publicRuntimeConfig`\n    *   `serverRuntimeConfig`\n    If any of these APIs are present and incompatible, replace them with the recommended alternatives in Next.js 15.5.4.\n\n*   **`next/link` Components:** Locate all instances of `<Link>` components imported from `next/link` and remove the `legacyBehavior` prop.\n\n**5.

Given the unknown starting version, you might need to run this command multiple times or manually review and adjust the changes made by the codemod.\n3.  **API and Feature Research:** Given that you do not know the starting version of Next.js, it is absolutely *critical* that you consult the official Next.js documentation and upgrade guides for *every version* between your current version and 15.5.4. This will help you identify any deprecated APIs, breaking changes, or new features that you may want to take advantage of.\n\n**Build and Test Process:**\n\n1.  Run `npm install` to install the updated dependencies.\n2.  Run `npm run build` to compile the application.\n3.  Run `npm run lint` to check for linting errors.\n4.  Run `npm run test` to execute your test suite and verify that the application is functioning correctly.\n\nBecause of the potential for significant changes across multiple Next.js versions, I strongly recommend that you consider performing a **staged upgrade**. This involves upgrading to an intermediate version of Next.js first (for example, Next.js 14), addressing any compatibility issues that arise, and then upgrading to version 15.5.4. This approach can make the overall upgrade process more manageable.\n",
