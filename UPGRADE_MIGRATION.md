  "message": "OK. Here's a plan to prepare the codebase for an upgrade of Next.js from an unknown version to 15.5.4.\n\n**1. package.json:**\n\n*   **Update Next.js:** Change the `next` dependency version to `15.5.4`.\n*   **React and Related:** Carefully review the currently installed versions of `react`, `react-dom`, `@types/react`, and `@types/react-dom`. Update these to compatible versions according to the Next.js documentation for 15.5.4.\n*   **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install`. If you encounter peer dependency issues during the install process, use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.\n\n**2. next.config.js:**\n\n*   **Review for Deprecations/Breaking Changes:** Since the starting version is unknown, you must review your `next.config.js` file for any deprecated configurations or breaking changes that have been introduced between your current version and 15.5.4. This involves carefully checking the Next.js documentation for *each version* in that range.\n\n**3. tsconfig.json:**\n\n*   **Target:** Ensure that the `compilerOptions.target` is set to `es6` or a more recent ECMAScript version.\n\n**4. Codebase (app/page.tsx, app/layout.tsx, pages/index.tsx):**\n\n*   **API Compatibility:** Search your application code for any usages of the following APIs, and verify that they are compatible with Next.js 15.5.4. Update them with supported alternatives if needed.\n    *   `useFormState`\n    *   `useActionState`\n    *   `NextRequest geo`\n    *   `NextRequest ip`\n    *   `cookies.get`\n    *   `headers.get`\n    *   `publicRuntimeConfig`\n    *   `serverRuntimeConfig`\n\n*   **`next/link` Components:** Search your codebase for all instances of `<Link>` components imported from `next/link` and remove the `legacyBehavior` prop.\n\n**5. Linting Configuration (.eslintrc.js):**\n\n*   **Migrate to ESLint:** Run the command `npx @next/codemod@latest next-lint-to-eslint-cli` to migrate from the older `next lint` system to ESLint.\n*   **Configuration:** Review the generated `.eslintrc.js` file to ensure it is configured appropriately for your project.\n\n**General Upgrade Steps:**\n\n1.  **Node.js Version:** Ensure that your Node.js version is at least 18.18.0.\n2.  **Codemods:** Run `npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest` to automatically update your code for compatibility. Since you do not know the starting version, you might need to run this command multiple times.\n3.  **API and Feature Research:** Since the starting version is unknown, this is *critical*. You must consult the official Next.js documentation and upgrade guides for *every version* between your current version and 15.5.4 to identify any deprecated APIs, breaking changes, and new features that you want to adopt.\n\n**Build and Test Process:**\n\n1.  Run `npm install` to install the updated dependencies.\n2.  Run `npm run build` to compile the application.\n3.  Run `npm run lint` to check for linting errors.\n4.  Run `npm run test` to execute your test suite and verify that the application functions correctly.\n\nGiven the potential for breaking changes and the unknown starting point, I highly recommend a **staged upgrade**. This involves upgrading to an intermediate version of Next.js first (e.g., Next.js 14), addressing any compatibility issues, and then upgrading to 15.5.4. This makes the process much more manageable.\n",
